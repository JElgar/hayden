                        Today our society finds itself racing
                        towards a greater level of automa
                        -
                        tion. Jobs which were previously
                        considered low skilled labour are
                        already fulfilled by automatons, with
                        higher skill level jobs looking join
                        them in the near future. With less
                        jobs being completed by human
                        workers, it begs the question; How
                        will our society look without work?
                        An issue which could be addressed
                        within the post-work world is our
                        relationship with death. Today,
                        we often neglect our mortality to
                        focus on our working life. When a
                        member of the family passes away,
                        often people struggle to find time to
                        address the process of mourning.
                        This can lead to long term mental
                        health issues.
                        I propose the Hollyoak Centre.
                        The centre will look to address
                        mortality throughout all stages
                        of life and commemorate life in a
                        slower fashion. This could greatly
                        improve our outlook on life. Instead
                        of fearing or ignoring our end, could
                        we focus on understanding what it
                        means to be alive. A new approach
                        to death should tackle three key
                        areas: Understanding, Ceremony,
                        and Memorial.
                        A precedent for how we could
                        refresh our understanding of death
                        can be found in The Maggie’s Cen

                        orientate around providing palliative
                        care in a non-clinical, homely
                        environment and the creation of
                        a strong, supportive community.
                        Within this environment they
                        provide a plethora of services which
                        focus on lifestyle and mental health.
